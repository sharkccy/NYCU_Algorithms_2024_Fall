# HW2 — Red-Black Tree Implementation
StudentID: 110612117

Name: Chung-Yu Chang (張仲瑜)

Introduction:
 - Implementation of Exercise 2 for the Algorithm Analysis course. See the specification in `Exercise#2 Spec.pdf` for problem details and required behavior.
 - The solution is provided in `Exercise2_110612117.cpp` and includes sample `input.txt` / `output.txt` in the `hw2` folder.

Files:
 - `Exercise#2 Spec.pdf`: Problem specification and input/output format description.
 - `Exercise2_110612117.cpp`: C++ source implementing the exercise solution.
 - `input.txt`: Example input used by the program (test cases and tableaux).
 - `output.txt`: Program output produced after running the executable.
 - `Report.pdf`: A brief report discussing the implementation details and complexity analysis.

How to build
 - Compile the source with `g++`:

```bash
g++ hw2/Exercise2_110612117.cpp -O2 -std=c++17 -o hw2/Exercise2
```

How to run
 - Run the compiled program (the program reads/writes files in the `hw2` folder by default):

```bash
./hw2/Exercise2
# or on Windows PowerShell
./hw2/Exercise2.exe
```

 - Provide `input.txt` in the `hw2` directory as specified in `Exercise#2 Spec.pdf`; results appear in `output.txt`.

Notes:
 - Refer to `Exercise#2 Spec.pdf` for precise input format, constraints, and expected behaviors.
 - If you want me to run or test the code, I can compile and execute it with the available `input.txt`.
